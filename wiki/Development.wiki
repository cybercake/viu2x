#summary Development of viu2x. Tools & libs

= Development Environment =

All parts of *viu2x* is written in *C++* using *Code::Blocks* (http://www.codeblocks.org/). You can simply open the project files (.cbp) in *Code::Block* and build them using the menu.

*Code::Block* version 12.11 is currently used. You can download the installer from here: http://www.codeblocks.org/downloads/26. The built-in *MinGW*, which is installed with *Code::Blocks*, should be OK for compilation. There is generally no need to install *MinGW/GCC* separately.

= Libraries =

*viu2x* requires the following libraries:
  * *STL*
  * *Boost* (version 1.53 is currently used)
