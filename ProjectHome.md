**Viu 2x** is supposed to be a file/media browser enabling user to view data in diverse sources e.g. file system, Flickr or even in your mailbox.

It offers a minimalistic GUI yet rich functionality oriented to efficient image and multimedia content management.

**Viu 2x** is oriented mainly to Windows users. Yet platform-neutrality will be considered by designing the interface of each components, so that they can be easily implemented on other operating systems.

The **Viu 2x** source consists of following components:
  1. **viuTask** - A threading engine handling asynchronous data communication.
  1. **viuIO** - A file system lib that supports a unified accessing method to nearly all data sources.
  1. **viuMedia** - A media codec wrapper library with image/video support.
  1. **viuUI** - A simple GUI library offering efficiency and modern look and feel.
  1. **viu2x** - The main application.

**Viu 2x** is currently in the planning phase. Everything could be changed in the future.
